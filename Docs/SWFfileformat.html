<h1 align="center">SWF File Format Specification</h1>

<p> The SWF (pronounced 'swiff') file format was designed from the ground up to 
  deliver graphics and animation over the Internet. The SWF file format was designed 
  as a very efficient delivery format and not as a format for exchanging graphics 
  between graphics editors. It was designed to meet the following goals: </p>

<ul>
<li><span class="runInHead">On-screen Display&#151;</span>The format is primarily 
intended for on-screen display and so it supports anti-aliasing, fast rendering 
to a bitmap of any color format, animation and interactive buttons.</li>
<li><span class="runInHead">Extensibility&#151;</span>The format is a tagged format, 
so the format can be evolved with new features while maintaining backwards compatibility 
with older players.</li>
<li><span class="runInHead">Network Delivery&#151;</span>The files can be delivered 
over a network with limited and unpredictable bandwidth. The files are compressed 
to be small and support incremental rendering through streaming.</li>
<li><span class="runInHead">Simplicity&#151;</span>The format is simple so that 
the player is small and easily ported. Also, the player depends upon only a very 
limited set of operating system functionality.</li>
<li><span class="runInHead">File Independence&#151;</span>Files can be displayed 
without any dependence on external resources such as fonts.</li>
<li><span class="runInHead">Scalability&#151;</span>Different computers have different 
monitor resolutions and bit depths. Files work well on limited hardware, while 
taking advantage of more expensive hardware when it is available.</li>
<li><span class="runInHead">Speed&#151;</span>The files are designed to be rendered 
at a high quality very quickly.</li>
</ul>

<p>
The following document describes the file format in detail.

<h3>Container Format</h3>

<p> SWF files are stored in files with the extension .swf and currently for historical 
  reasons the MIME type is application/x-shockwave-flash. SWF files are binary 
  files stored as 8-bit bytes. The container format consists of a header block 
  with the structure shown below. </p>

<p>
Following the header are a series of tagged data blocks. Each data block has a tag type (stag) and a length. There is both a short and long tag format. Short tags are used for blocks with 62 bytes of data or less and large tags can be used for any size block. A short tag has 9 bits used for the block type and 6 bits used for a block length in number of bytes. If a block is 63 bytes or longer, it should be stored in a long tag which consists of a short tag whose length is 0x3f and is followed by a 32-bit length.
</p>

<p>
The following tables show the structure of both short and long tag record headers.
</p>

</table>


<p> Any program parsing a SWF file can skip over blocks it does not understand. 
  Data blocks can point to offsets within the block, but they should never point 
  to an offset in another block. This enables tags to be removed, inserted, or 
  modified by tools that process a SWF file. With some network transports like 
  RealFlash, data blocks can be reordered and delivered with different priorities. 
</p>

<p>
Currently, many useful block types are defined. Tag numbers 0-511 are reserved for future use. Tag numbers 512-1023 are reserved for use by third party applications. For more information on developing extension mechanisms, see the extension mechanism section. 
</p>

<a name="h3TypesofTags"> </a>
<h3>Types of Tags</h3>

<p>
Definition tags are used to add character information to the dictionary. Definition tags define data that can be reused in a file like shapes, bitmaps, buttons, text, fonts and sounds. Control tags manipulate characters and provide administrative functions. For example, control tags are used to move objects on the screen, show frames, and start sounds. For information on specific tags, see the Tag Reference section.
</p>

<a name="h3TagOrderingandStreaming"> </a>
<h3>Tag Ordering and Streaming</h3>

<p>
Tags can occur in the file in any order. Definition tags must occur in the file before any control tags that refer to the character that is defined. The order of control tags defines the order of the animation. 
</p>

<p> This ordering of tags is how the SWF file format supports streaming. The rule 
  is that a given tag should only depend on tags that come before it. A tag should 
  never depend on a tag that comes later in the file. </p>

<p>
The End tag should be used at the end of the file to indicate the file's end.
</p>

<a name="h3CharactersandtheDictionary"> </a>
<h3>Characters and the Dictionary</h3>

<p> In order to support streaming and references between tags, SWF uses the concept 
  of characters and a dictionary of characters that have been encountered so far 
  in a file. A character has a 16-bit numeric name. Every character in a file 
  must have a unique name. Typically, the first character is #1, the second character 
  is #2 and so on. Character #0 is special and considered a null character. </p>

<p>
Characters are entered into the dictionary when a define tag is encountered in the .swf file. Characters are looked up in the dictionary based on the character identification number.
</p>

<a name="h3DisplayList"> </a>
<h3>Display List</h3>

<p> Conceptually, the SWF file format can be considered as two interleaved streams 
  of data. The definition stream adds characters to the dictionary and the control 
  stream performs operations on the display list using the characters that have 
  been defined in the dictionary. </p>

<p> In SWF 1 and 2, the display list was a flat list of the objects that are present 
  on the screen at any given point in time. For SWF 3, this list has been extended 
  to a hierarchical list where an element on the display can have a list of child 
  elements. </p>

<p>
Objects on the display list are referred to by a depth number. The object at depth 0 is the bottom of the stacking order. Only one object can exist at any given depth.
</p>

<p>
There are three basic operations on the display list:
</p>


<ul>
<li><span class="runInHead">Place an object&#151;</span>Place an character on 
at a given depth level using a specified transform.</li>
<li><span class="runInHead">Move an object&#151;</span>Modify the object at the 
given depth level. Both the transform and the character can be modified.</li>
<li><span class="runInHead">Remove an object&#151;</span>Remove the object at 
a given depth number from the display.</li>
</ul>

<p> Note that for SWF 1 and 2, the only operations are Place and Remove. Move 
  was added to support sprites and as a size optimization for SWF 3. </p>

<a name="h3NumbersandCoordinates"> </a>
<h3>Numbers and Coordinates</h3>

<p> SWF uses integers and fixed point numbers for all of its coordinates and transformation 
  matrices. The coordinate space is defined by integer coordinates. This coordinate 
  space can be mapped to the display in any way that a player might want. By convention, 
  coordinates are specified where one unit equal 1/1440 inches. On a typical 72 
  dpi display this is equivalent to saying that a single pixel is divided into 
  20 units. This choice of units provides a good compromise between giving a high 
  resolution for zooming in and precise placement of objects. A higher resolution 
  would increased the file size because of the extra bits needed for precision. 
</p>

<a name="h3Transforms"> </a>
<h3>Transforms</h3>

<p>
<span class="runInHead">Matrices&#151;</span>Object positioning is specified by 
a standard 2x3 transformation matrix using 16.16 fixed point numbers for the first 
four elements and integers for the last two elements. 
</p>

<p> <span class="runInHead">Color Transforms&#151;</span>SWF uses color transforms 
  to perform effects like fading in or out from an object on the display. The 
  color transform consists of a simple linear equation that is applied to each 
  color element of an object. </p>

<p>
<span class="runInHead">Ratio&#151;</span>For some objects like morphed shapes, 
a 16-bit ratio is used to control what point in the morph should be displayed. 
The ratio is also used to track the lifetime of sprite objects. 
</p>

<p> <span class="runInHead">Clip depth&#151;</span>An object on the SWF display 
  list can be used as a clipping path for range of objects. This is controlled 
  by the clip depth field for Place object. </p>

<a name="h3ProcessingaSWFFile"> </a>
<h3>Processing a SWF File</h3>

<p>
The model for processing a stream is that all tags are processed in a stream until a ShowFrame tag is encountered.  At that point, the display list is copied to the screen and the player is idle until it is time to process the next frame.
</p>

<p> A SWF file is divided into numbered frames by ShowFrame tags. Frame 1 is defined 
  by performing all the control operations before the first ShowFrame tag. Frame 
  2 is defined by performing all the control operations before the second ShowFrame 
  tag and so on. </p>

<a name="h3FileCompressionStrategy"> </a>
<h3>File Compression Strategy</h3>

<p> Since SWF files are frequently delivered over a network connection, it is 
  important that they be as compact as possible. There are several techniques 
  that are used to accomplish this: </p>


<ul>
  <li><span class="runInHead">Reuse&#151;</span>The structure of the character dictionary 
    makes it very easy to reuse elements in a SWF file. For example, a shape, 
    button, sound, font, or bitmap can be stored in a file once and referenced 
    many times.</li>  <li><span class="runInHead">Compression&#151;</span>The contents of tags are compressed. 
    SWF supports a variety of compression techniques. Bitmaps can be compressed 
    with JPEG or a PNG-like zlib compression. Sound is compressed with various 
    levels of ADPCM compression. Shapes are compressed using a very efficient 
    delta encoding scheme.</li>
<li><span class="runInHead">Bit Packing&#151;</span>Whenever possible, numbers 
are packed into the smallest possible number of bits for a particular value. Coordinates 
are commonly stored using variable-sized bit fields, where a few bits are used 
to indicate how many bits are needed by subsequent values. See RECT for an example.</li>
<li><span class="runInHead">Default values&#151;</span>Some structures like matrices 
and color transforms have common fields that are used more often than others. 
For example, for a matrix, the most common field is the translation field. Scaling 
and rotation are less common. Therefore if the scaling field is not present, it 
is assumed to be 100%. If the rotation field is not present, it is assumed that 
there is no rotation. This use of default values helps to minimize file sizes.</li>
  <li><span class="runInHead">Change Encoding&#151;</span>As a rule, SWF files just 
    store the changes between states. This is reflected in shape data structures 
    and in the place/move/remove model used by the display list.</li>
<li><span class="runInHead">Shape Data Structure&#151;</span>The shape data structure 
uses a unique structure to minimize the size of shapes and to render anti-aliased 
shapes very efficiently on the screen.</li>
</ul>

<p> Note that although the individual components of a SWF file are compressed, 
  there is no overall compression applied to the .swf file. This makes it possible 
  for a player to process the file structure directly out of RAM without decompressing 
  it. Various elements of the file such as bitmaps, shapes and sounds can be decompressed 
  as they are needed. </p>

<a name="h3ExtensionMechanism"> </a>
<h3>Extension Mechanism</h3>

<p>
In order to let applications define their own tag types, it is possible to define an AppExtension tag that contains the name of the application functionality being implemented and a tag range that describe what tags will be used by this extension set. The extension sets should be similar to a MIME type where they take the form of the following string:
</p>

<pre>
&lt;company name&gt;/&lt;extension set&gt;
</pre>


<p>
For the entire file, these tag types will be interpreted in the context of the named extension. Applications should be able to remap the tag range for a particular file to avoid conflicts between two extension sets.
</p>

<p>
The extension must be in the 512-1023 tag type range.
